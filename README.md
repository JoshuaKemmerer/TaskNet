# TaskNet
An Android application for keeping track of deadlines, general tasks to complete, and ongoing tasks.

The purpose of this Android application is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for the purpose of creating, managing, and accomplishing several different types of tasks:

- **Deadline Tasks**  Tasks that have a date, but do not end. Useful for reminding one's self of upcoming homework assignments.
- **On-going Tasks**  Tasks that have a begin and end date. These appear "pinned" in the TaskNet, and are always visible. Begin date stored is the date of creation, and this type of task can have an end date added (will exist indefinitely as long as no end-date is provided).
- **One-time Event/Task**  Very similar to on-going tasks, these also have a begin and end date; however, begin and end date must be specified by the user. This type of tasks is usually created for a future event, and will contain reminders that may be added.

## Motivation for This Project

The motivation for this project was that I personally became confused with what projects/assignments were due for school, mostly during the busier weeks. I want an intuitive and sensible interface to combine all of the different tasks I want/need to accomplish, and this is my solution.

I also have a desire to help other people become more organized, so I hope that this solution will one day help others.
